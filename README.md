# Watson Chatbot Template

### OBJECTIVE
This template has been implemented in order to conect the Inbenta Federated Search API and the **IBM Watson Assistant**, with the minimum configuration and effort. The main library of this template is Watson Federared Search, which extends from a base library named [Chatbot API Connector](https://github.com/inbenta-integrations/chatbot_api_connector), built to be used as a base for different external services like Facebook, Skype, Line, etc.

This template includes **/conf** and **/lang** folders, which have all the configuration and translations required by the libraries, and a small file **server.php** which creates an WatsonConnectorâ€™s instance in order to handle all the incoming requests.

### FUNCTIONALITIES
This bot template inherits the functionalities from the `ChatbotConnector` library. Currently, the feature provided by this application is:

* Search Result Answers


### INSTALLATION
It's pretty simple to get this UI working. The mandatory configuration files are included by default in `/conf/custom` to be filled in, so you have to provide the information required in these files:

* **File 'api.php'**
    Provide the API Key and API Secret of your Chatbot Instance.

* **File 'configuration.php'**
    Provide the Token, defined by the customer. Any password-like value is valid.

* **File 'environments.php'**
    Here you can define regexes to detect `development` environment. If the regexes do not match the current conditions or there isn't any regex configured, `production` environment will be assumed.


### HOW TO CUSTOMIZE
**From configuration**

For a default behavior, the only requisite is to fill the basic configuration (more information in `/conf/README.md`). There are some extra configuration parameters in the configuration files that allow you to modify the basic-behavior.


**Custom Behaviors**

If you need to customize the bot flow, you need to extend the class `WatsonConnector`, included in the `/lib/WatsonConnector` folder. You can modify 'WatsonConnector' methods and override all the parent methods from `ChatbotConnector`.


### DEPENDENCIES
This application imports `inbenta/chatbot-api-connector` as a Composer dependency, that includes `symfony/http-foundation@^3.1` and `guzzlehttp/guzzle@~6.0` as dependencies too. You will also need `ralouphie/getallheaders`


### To enable all capabilities, you need:
- Use the ANSWER_TEXT as text only
- Create a setting "CONVERSATION_ENDED"
- Farewell content:
	- Must be matched when the user says something to end the conversation
	- Add a directCall with the text "sys-goodbye"
	- Add "Learn with semantic expansion" with the variations to end a call (like "goodbye", "end call", etc).
