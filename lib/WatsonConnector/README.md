### OBJECTIVE

This Watson connector extends from the [Chatbot API Connector](https://github.com/inbenta-integrations/chatbot_api_connector) library. It translates Watson messages into the Inbenta Federated Search API format and vice versa.

### FUNCTIONALITIES
This connector inherits the functionalities from the `ChatbotConnector` library. Currently, the features provided by this application are:

* Search Responses
* Rich text

### HOW TO CUSTOMIZE

**Custom Behaviors**

If you need to customize the bot flow, you need to modify the class `WatsonConnector.php`. This class extends from the ChatbotConnector and here you can override all the parent methods, although few are used with this connector.


### STRUCTURE

The `WatsonConnector` folder has some classes needed to use the ChatbotConnector with Watson. These classes are used in the WatsonConnector constructor in order to provide the application with the components needed to send information to Watson.

**External API folder**

Inside this folder there is the Watson API client which allows the bot to set the message that Watson will read.


**External Digester folder**

This folder contains the class WatsonDigester. This class is a kind of "translator" between the Chatbot API and Watson. Mainly, the work performed by this class is to convert a message from the Chatbot API into a message accepted by Watson. It also does the inverse work, translating messages from Watson into the format required by the Chatbot API.
